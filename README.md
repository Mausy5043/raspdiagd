**Raspberry Pi Diagnostics Gatherer**
This repository provides a number of python-based daemons that gather some system diagnostics.

The code used to daemonise python code was borrowed from previous work by:
- Sander Marechal (see: http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/)
- Charles Menguy (see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10217067/implementing-a-full-python-unix-style-daemon-process)

and modified for my particular use-case.
